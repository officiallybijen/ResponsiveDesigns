            <p>The benefit of several years of experience at my law office is that I understand the concerns of families 
                facing numerous obstacles while struggling with divorce and custody matters. That is why I care about 
                quality and not the quantity of work, so my goal with every case I take is to provide excellent service 
                to my clients.

                    Divorce can be a difficult time, with both emotional and legal problems. Many people who go through it 
                    find themselves vulnerable and make bad decisions. That is why it is so important to get a lawyer, as 
                    an advisor of the whole legal process. They will get to know all the causes for the divorce and the 
                    relationship between both parties, so they will be able to look for the best solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A divorce lawyer works towards the most favourable way for his client to divide the family estate. In 
                    some cases, each spouse may separate the property they brought into the marriage, while others may 
                    have accumulated assets separately according to an agreement. An attorney can explain whether the estate 
                    is a community property estate or an appropriate distribution estate, which can make a drastic difference 
                    in the distribution of marital property.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    As an attorney, I work hard to make this process less traumatic. I provide objective advice to my clients 
                    on how the process may affect their future, and I can also serve as an intermediary between spouses if they
                    wish to avoid personal contact to facilitate the process.

            <h1>How can I help you as a family lawyer?</h1>
            <div class="help-group" >
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/1st.svg" alt=""><h3>Divorce Uncontested</h3><p>When both spouses agree to divorce, the process is much easier. Even so, it is advisable to have a lawyer handle the process.</p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/2nd.svg" alt=""><h3>Domestic Violence</h3><p>Is a fundamental matter in which a lawyer can also help if you need protection for yourself or your children.
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/3rd.svg" alt=""><h3>Properties</h3><p>Receive advice about the properties owned by the couple. A marital agreement might provide a different context if properties were acquired before or after the nuptials.
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/4th.svg" alt=""><h3>Marriage Contracts and Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements</h3><p>The best cure is prevention. A marital agreement, either prenuptial or postnuptial, can prevent many misunderstandings in the couple in the event of divorce. Avoid difficult breakups with a prenuptial agreement.
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/Vector-4.svg" alt=""><h3>Foreign Divorce Legal Opinion Letters</h3><p>Only a few lawyers are qualified to issue Foreign Divorce Legal Opinion letters. I provide that service, which is necessary to prove that you have been divorced in a foreign country (or Canada, after being married in another country).
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/Vector-5.svg" alt=""><h3>Financial Statements and Spousal Support</h3><p>Refers to the obligation of a person to provide financial support to their spouse after separation or divorce. This support is given when one spouse is financially dependent on the other or has custody of the children.
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/Vector-6.svg" alt=""><h3>Independent Legal Advice</h3><p>Before signing any legal agreement regarding marriage or family, it is recommended for the signatory to seek independent legal advice. A marital agreement affects the signatories in the event of divorce, so they should consider what the best deal is.</p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/Vector-7.svg" alt=""><h3>Filing and Defending Motions</h3><p> If there are significant problems with the divorce and you need a temporary restraining order or protective order, you will need a specialized attorney. I provide that service if you consider yourself in danger because of the divorce.
                </p></div>
                <div class="help-item"><img src="img/Vector-8.svg" alt=""><h3>Cohabitation Agreements</h3><p>May seem unromantic, but they will prevent many relationship problems. Agreeing on the rules of cohabitation is much safer when done in front of a lawyer. With this agreement, the partners can decide how to act in case of any personal or financial problems.</p></div>
                <div class="help-item" style="grid-column: 2;"><img src="img/Vector-9.svg" alt=""><h3>Child Custody and Support</h3><p>Child custody is a serious concern after divorce, and as  a family lawyer, I can bring facts to the table to reach a final decision. This process also takes place if there is an adopted child.</p></div>
